# MERN Stack Projects

Welcome to the **MERN Stack Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of web development projects built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

These projects are designed to help you learn, explore, and experiment with the power of full-stack JavaScript development. Each project is an individual learning experience with detailed code and explanations.

## Introduction

The **MERN stack** is a popular and powerful set of technologies that allows developers to build full-stack web applications using JavaScript. The stack consists of:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Express.js**: A fast web application framework for Node.js.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

This repository contains various MERN stack projects that demonstrate the integration of these technologies. These projects are perfect for developers looking to learn the full-stack approach, experiment with different concepts, or build something useful.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL Database
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive UIs
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For authentication
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests
- **Bcrypt.js**: For password hashing
- **Nodemon**: For auto-restarting the server during development

## Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions to clone and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Download and install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-projects.git`
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd mern-stack-projects`
    
3. Install the necessary dependencies for both the client (React) and server (Node.js):
    
    - For the **backend**:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `cd backend npm install`
        
    - For the **frontend**:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `cd frontend npm install`
        

## How to Run

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the projects locally:

### Running the Backend (Server)

1. Navigate to the backend directory if you're not already there:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd backend`
    
2. Start the server:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm run dev`
    
    This will start the server on `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port you configured).
    

### Running the Frontend (Client)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd frontend`
    
2. Start the React app:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm start`
    
3. The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    

### Testing

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you should be able to interact with the full-stack application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
